# Simulating-Atoms-in-a-Cavity
Developed as part of a quantum optics class; simulates atoms in a cavity by solving master equations or quantum jump emthod

This project discusses the simulation of an open quantum system consists of atoms and a cavity. We first numerically solve the master equation of a single atom in a cavity and then use quantum jump method to study the same problems. Then, we generalize our discussion to multiple atoms in a cavity.
